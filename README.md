# Dynamic React Dashboard

I used this to learn how to connect a websocket to a dashboard.

i wanted the dashboard to be able to dynamically alter it's contents depending on what it got from the websocket.

As a final challange, be able to sent selctions and actions the user names back through the websocoket.
